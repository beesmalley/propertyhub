                    The goal of the project is designing and developing a website allowing sellers to manage sales data. The website consists of three main components: a Seller Dashboard, an About Page, and a Login/Registration Page.
                </p>
                <h5 class="pad">Seller Dashboard:</h5>
                <p>
                    The Seller Dashboard is the primary interface sellers use to manage sales data. The dashboard provides access to sales data, including age, location, floor plans, and other relevant metrics.
                </p>
                <h5 class="pad">About Page:</h5>
                <p>
                    The About Page is this page! It's a simple, informative page introducing the website to potential users. The page includes details about the purpose of the site, its features, and benefits. The About Page also provides (fake) contact information for users who want to reach out for support/assistance.
                </p>
                <h5 class="pad">Login/Registration Page:</h5>
                <p>
                    The Login/Registration Page is how the users access the Seller Dashboard. New users are required to register for an account before accessing the dashboard. The registration process involves collecting basic info such as username and password. Users who have already registered are able to log in using said username and password.
